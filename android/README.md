##### Android SDK for JINS MEME ACADEMIC PACK

* When developing your own software with Android SDK, you have 2 choices regarding how to connect JINS MEME Hardware with Android. One way is a connection using the official USB(BLE) dongle, and the other is the direct connection with BLD embedded in Android device. 

* It seems that direct connection on Android OS 6 doesn't work correctly (edited 6.Jun.2016).
